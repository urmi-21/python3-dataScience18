#1. We know len() returns the length of a string. Define a function that takes a string as an argument
# and prints its squared length. E.g. if input to function is 'ABCD' return value should be 16.
# use def and lambda functions


#2. Write another function that takes two strings as arguments and returns the sum of square of lengths of the two Strings.
# E.g. if in put to function is 'ABC' and 'DE' return value should be 9+4=13.


#3. Let me define a term "pythagorean string triplets" as set of three strings such that squared length of any one is
# equal to the sum of the squared lengths of other two. Given three strings check whether they form a pythagorean string triplet.
# Hint: You don't have to check each possible combination, just check if the largest string's squared length is equal to
# sum of squared lengths of the other two.
